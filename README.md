# Sign Language Detection Using Machine Learning

This project focuses on detecting hand gestures used in sign language and translating them into text using computer vision and machine learning. It aims to assist the hearing and speech impaired community by providing a communication bridge through gesture recognition.

## 📌 Features

- Real-time hand gesture detection via webcam
- Classification of ASL (American Sign Language) alphabets or custom signs
- Machine learning model trained using image datasets
- Easy-to-use interface for predictions
- Custom dataset integration possible

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Scikit-learn
- MediaPipe (for hand detection)
- Jupyter Notebook (for training and analysis)
